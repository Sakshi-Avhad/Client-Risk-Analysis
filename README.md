✅ Project Overview
This project is a Client Risk & Financial Health Dashboard developed using Power BI.
It helps businesses assess the financial stability and risk exposure of their clients by providing interactive and easy-to-understand visualizations.
The dashboard enables better decision-making for lending, savings management, and customer relationship planning.

✅ Problem Statement
Many organizations face challenges in understanding client behavior, assessing their risk, and making data-driven decisions.
Without clear insights into borrowing patterns, income stability, and savings, it becomes difficult to identify clients who are financially healthy or at risk.
This dashboard addresses this issue by analyzing key financial metrics and presenting them through interactive visuals that allow users to filter, explore, and derive actionable insights.

✅ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard focuses on the following metrics to analyze client financial health:
Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR)
→ Measures how much a client borrows relative to their savings.
→ High ratio indicates risk; low ratio shows financial stability.

Debt to Income Ratio (DTI)
→ Shows the proportion of client debt compared to income.
→ High ratio signals repayment challenges.

Savings Ratio
→ Indicates how much of a client’s income is being saved.
→ High savings reflect good financial planning;
low savings imply potential risk.

✅ Tools & Techniques
Python (for Exploratory Data Analysis – EDA) → exploring data before importing it into Power BI.
SQL → Used to query and extract relevant data from relational databases.
Excel → Used for initial data aggregation, formatting, and preprocessing.
Power BI Desktop → Used to create interactive reports and visualizations with advanced data modeling.
Power BI Service → Used for publishing the reports, enabling sharing, and scheduling data refreshes for up-to-date insights.
